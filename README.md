# What`s CoconutEngine ?

CoconutEngine is a complete solution for game developpers created by GATEntertainment Studios, which is
actually a french association in Guadeloupe. The software name would be funny but it`s a way to tell
you where we come from.

# We have a project !

To tell the truth we don't have only one project but a lot. We`re not going to tell you all of them for now.
We can just tell you that you can access our website source code, you can go on it here :  https://github.com/GATEntertainment/GATEntertainmentWebSite

All the points that you need to know :
* This project is supposed to be free ;
* We'll need your help soon ;
* It`s not supposed to be a stand-alone framework ;
* We`re teenagers.

# How about licensing ?

Licensing is a very important point in our projects. Our wish is that you can reuse this code freely but not as a
commercial product and we can use it to create commercial content like video games or stuff like that.

That`s why we are currently working on a specific license for our softwares, it could take a long time to use to write
it in accordance to the French law.

We've already thought about company who would like to use our engine in theirs own productions, the engine will be published
under differents license terms :
* a first one for **normal** users ;
* and a second one for **commercial** users ;

# It`s a framework !

Yes, CoconutEngine is designed to be a **HUGE** framework. In it we'll find :
* graphic engine ;
* physic engine ;
* audio engine ;
* artificial inteligence ;
* script language(s) ;
* etc...

# Thank you guys
